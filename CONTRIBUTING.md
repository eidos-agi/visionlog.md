# Contributing to visionlog

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eidos-agi/visionlog.md.git
cd visionlog.md
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Development

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting:

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## For agent developers

If you're building tools that AI agents will use, pay special attention to:

1. **Tool descriptions** — Every `@tool` decorator must have a description that explains *when* to use it, not just *what* it does. An agent choosing between 20 tools needs clear differentiation.
2. **Parameter descriptions** — Every parameter needs a `description` field. Agents don't have UI tooltips — the description is all they get.
3. **Error messages** — When something fails, the error message must tell the agent what to do next. "Invalid input" is useless. "Expected ISO 8601 date string (e.g., 2026-03-22), got: 'yesterday'" is actionable.
4. **Typed everything** — Type hints on all public functions. Agents parse types to understand contracts.
